Main project is in "gamesketching", run paint.pde as a Processing sketch. Unfortunately, Processing is really finicky with structuring project hierarchies, so pls don't mind the mess. Hoping to pick this up where I left off some time soon, with web technologies instead! :-)

Current state of affairs is the following, UI is bleh/temporary and pretty much for debugging!

Aaand much more... it's all pretty modular, I just don't have the UI to showcase that yet.
